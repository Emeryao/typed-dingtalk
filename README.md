### About the jsdoc comment
* all Chinese punctuations in comments are removed
* a comment quoted by `"` means it is directly copy/paste from the official documentaion
* a comment quoted by `'` means it is copied from the official documentation and had been modified
    > a common scenario is removing some useless messages like `"the type is number blablabla"`
* a comment has no quotes means it is written by myself
